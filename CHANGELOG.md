# Berty's Botz changelog (structured)

**Chip: BB 0.18.0** · 2026-09-21 · channel **live**  
Source of truth: `js/version.js` + this file.  
If the intern and an old zip disagree, the chip wins.

English notes for the period board. Teachers do not need to code.

---

## Version law

| Kind | Looks like | Where it goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec / scaffold | `BB 0.0.x` | Repo only. No cart. |
| Debug drop | `BB 0.1.0-d3` | Workshop / intern. Chip must say **DEBUG**. Not the classroom URL. |
| Live classroom | `BB 0.18.0` | `https://apps.kulibert.net/bertybots/` |

Rules:

1. One job per version. Pause until GO.
2. Every push that changes play or save bumps the chip **in the same commit**.
3. Debug increments the `-dN` suffix (`-d1`, `-d2`…). Do not skip. Do not reuse.
4. Promote a debug train by dropping `-dN` and writing the teacher notes for that live number.
5. Never leave DEBUG on the projector. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) if a cart still shows an old chip.
6. Student `.bertybots.json` may store `app` + `format` + `title` only. No names. Optional `appVersion` is the chip string, not a person.
7. Do not graft third-party game assets, official layouts, or `fcsim`.

## 0.19.34 — Turn the phone — 2026-10-03

- Turning the phone re-fits the board, the same as opening it sideways. The ground stays on screen.
- On an upright phone the Shop Floor is big enough to grab. GOAL still points at PARK, and ◀ comes back.
- What's new: The board fits again when you turn your phone. Wheels are easier to grab on a phone.

## 0.19.33 — Phone fit — 2026-10-02

- Settings opens from the left. Close sits at the top. Esc closes it and focus returns to Settings.
- The shop fits an upright phone. The board letterboxes so the wheel and the goal stay on screen.
- What's new: Settings opens from the left with Close at the top. The playfield fits phones held upright.

## 0.19.32 — Menu rows — 2026-10-02

- What's new and Settings are rows in the left Menu, under the plate.
- English follows the Hub language on the first paint. English stays English.
- The shop no longer blocks portrait. Kids can rotate the Chromebook.

## 0.19.31 — Hub language — 2026-10-02

- The shop follows the Hub language (English, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dari, Kinyarwanda, Tigrinya). Arabic and Dari flip the words, not the board.
- Every part has a name under its picture. Play, Step, and Stop say so. Menu sits at the top-left and opens from the left.
- What's new: Botz speaks your Hub language, and every part has a name.

## 0.19.29 — Race polish — 2026-09-28

- Race plates match the shop. A Race label separates them from the build jobs.
- Gates are posts and a number, not a muddy box. The clock sits at the top center.

## 0.19.28 — Races — 2026-09-28

- Sprint, Gates, and Long Lap. The clock starts on Play. Gates must be passed in order. Best time stays on this Chromebook. No names.
- The build jobs are unchanged. Race plates sit after them.

## 0.19.27 — Optional curriculum — 2026-09-28

- Curriculum is off until you turn it on. Then the six design steps, Measure, Forces, and Systems sit above the shop. The build jobs stay.
- Assign with `?curriculum=1`. Turn off with `?curriculum=0` or Menu → More → Curriculum.

## 0.19.26 — Look at the goal — 2026-09-27

- The GOAL button jumps the view to the stripes. The job number, or H, brings the crate back. G does the look.
- The job name sits next to the numbers.

## 0.19.25 — Closer — 2026-09-27

- The camera sits on the crate, not the empty shop.
- The GOAL mark stays inside the screen.

## 0.19.24 — Big enough to grab — 2026-09-27

- The shop starts close again. Scroll still reaches a far Drop Zone.
- If the stripes are off screen, a GOAL arrow points at them.
- The job you are on has a ring, so it is not confused with the next one.

## 0.19.23 — Tools look like tools — 2026-09-27

- Shortcut chips no longer sit on the pictures. They show when you point at a button.
- The guide opens as a paper card up high, off the crate.

## 0.19.22 — You can look at the goal — 2026-09-27

- The Drop Zone is in the frame. Scroll sideways to move along the job. Ctrl-scroll zooms. The view still cannot leave the job.

## 0.19.21 — Next job is one click — 2026-09-27

- Next job opens Job 2 on the first click. The clear card closes when you pick a job.
- Slow stays on the top row. The footer stays a short line.

## 0.19.20 — Keys — 2026-09-27

- 1–5 pick parts, E erases, M moves, Space plays, S is slow, Esc stops, Z undoes. The key sits on the button.

## 0.19.19 — Stay on the job — 2026-09-27

- The camera cannot wander off into the brick wall.
- The hanging shop lights are gone. They looked like the puzzle.

## 0.19.18 — Berty points — 2026-09-27

- The shop opens closer, on the machine.
- Berty, in a hard hat, flies in the shop and points with a big speech bubble.

## 0.19.17 — Center, then a side — 2026-09-27

- A wheel locks to its center first. Push past the rim to catch a quadrant.

## 0.19.16 — The shop stays still — 2026-09-27

- The tool bar no longer grows and shrinks. The playfield does not jump.

## 0.19.15 — The line fits — 2026-09-26

- The bottom line is the only text while you build, and it is short enough to read.
- The stripes say PARK once. A clear is one card, then the next job.

## 0.19.14 — Three different moves — 2026-09-26

- Up the Curb starts with the blue wheel. It rolls the wrong way. The orange one climbs the step.
- The Wall is not a movie. The orange wheel hits the wall. The blue one goes the other way.
- High Shelf starts solved except a loose wheel sitting on the step. Drag it off.
- A clear freezes the parked machine and puts a small card in the corner, so the machine stays the picture.

## 0.19.13 — The hole eats the old wheel — 2026-09-26

- Mind the Pit is wide enough that the wheel from the earlier jobs falls in. A silver bar across the hole parks the crate.
- A miss leaves a Stopped mark. The stripes say PARK. The miss line says what happened, not "process."

## 0.19.12 — The toy stays up — 2026-09-26

- Build jobs keep the extra buttons hidden. One line tells you the move.
- Job 2 starts with a loose wheel. The step, the hole, the low wall, and the two steps are close enough to see. Pair needs a bar between the crates.

## 0.19.11 — Fix the cart — 2026-09-26

- Job 1 opens on a broken cart. Drag the right wheel behind the crate, then Play.
- Build jobs are Fix it, Roll Out, Curb, Pit, Wall, Shelf, Pair. Measure and Forces sit in Menu. Around the Bend stays off the strip.
- A clear is a card, then the next job.

## Current train (0.18.x live)
